So the requirement is to come out with 3 novel solutions to the sum of n numbers
My first thought immediately started with iterating it incrementally
Next method I thought of was iteratively
Then I recalled sometime back in Uni that this is a series of Natural numbers which can be represented by a formula.
This question was a good starter.
run command : node sum_to_n.js
test suite : jest 
test command : npm run test
