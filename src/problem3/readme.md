Now this is a little start to the data parsing from a given data source.
I had fun too!
I encountered a few problems on using the default nodejs's fetch, so I had to import node-fetch for this requirement.
made a little test to check for the return of the promise is an array as well.
run command : node datasource.js
test suite : jest 
test command : npm run test
